***Task 1: Redesigning a Website Landing Page***

As part of my UI/UX internship, I was assigned the task of redesigning an existing website landing page to improve its usability and aesthetics. The goal of this redesign was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience while maintaining the core functionalities of the original page. To accomplish this, I chose to redesign a real estate rental and buying application landing page using Figma with prototyping features.

Understanding the Original Design

Before starting the redesign, I carefully analyzed various real estate applications to understand their layout, navigation flow, and overall user experience. I identified key issues commonly found in existing designs, such as cluttered interfaces, complex search functionality, and a lack of intuitive user interaction. My goal was to simplify the design while maintaining all necessary features in a more structured and visually appealing way.

Design Approach and Improvements

For the redesigned landing page, I focused on the following key areas to enhance usability:

**1. Clean and Minimalist UI**

I adopted a minimalistic and modern UI design to improve readability and ease of navigation. The interface primarily uses soft, neutral tones with a dominant red accent color to highlight important interactive elements such as buttons and icons. The use of white space ensures that the design feels light and uncluttered, providing a smooth browsing experience.

**2. User-Centric Navigation**

To enhance user accessibility, I organized the landing page into two main screens:

The first screen allows users to filter their home search based on location, price range, and number of bedrooms. This ensures that users can quickly narrow down their search results without going through unnecessary steps.

The second screen showcases the available property listings with clear visual previews and essential details like price, rating, and amenities. This structure allows users to make quick, informed decisions.

**3. Interactive Filters and Input Fields**

To make the search process smoother, I integrated interactive input fields for location selection, date range, price, and number of beds. The buttons and input fields are styled with soft rounded edges and subtle shadows to enhance their visibility and usability. The use of red-colored accents for selected options makes it easy for users to differentiate active choices.

**4. Visual Hierarchy and Typography**

I used a well-defined visual hierarchy to guide users’ attention toward the most important elements. The header text uses a bold font to emphasize key sections like "Let’s Get Started" and "Best Offers." The property listing details are displayed using a clear and legible font, ensuring that users can quickly scan through the information.

**5. Prototyping and User Interaction**

To make the experience more interactive, I implemented Figma prototyping, allowing users to navigate between screens seamlessly. The prototype simulates real-time interactions such as clicking on filters, selecting a property, and viewing more details. This provides a realistic preview of how the actual app would function, making it easier to gather feedback and refine the design further.

**Conclusion**

This redesign not only improves the visual appeal of the landing page but also enhances user engagement through a well-structured and interactive design. By simplifying navigation, optimizing filters, and maintaining a clean layout, the page provides an intuitive and seamless experience for users searching for properties. Through this project, I have strengthened my skills in UI/UX design principles, visual hierarchy, typography, and interactive prototyping using Figma. This task was a great learning experience in improving digital interfaces for better usability and customer satisfaction.
